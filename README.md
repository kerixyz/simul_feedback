# simul_feedback

This project is a proof of concept for building an AI-powered feedback system for Twitch streamers. The system takes a Twitch channel link as input, scrapes relevant data from the channel, and uses generative AI models to provide actionable feedback summaries based on the extracted information.

---

## **Project Scope**

The proof of concept consists of three main components:

1. **Input**: A Twitch channel link provided by the user.
2. **Scraper**: A Python-based web scraper that extracts relevant streamer data from the Twitch page (e.g., bio, clips, schedule, follower count).
3. **Notebook for Prompt Engineering**: A Jupyter Notebook for testing and refining prompts to generate feedback using a large language model (LLM), such as GPT-4.
4. **Pipeline for Feedback Summaries**: A modular pipeline that processes scraped data, feeds it into an LLM, and generates structured feedback summaries for streamers.

---

## **Features**

### **1. Input**
- Accepts a Twitch channel link as input (e.g., `https://www.twitch.tv/example_channel`).

### **2. Scraper**
- Extracts key information from the Twitch channel page:
  - Bio and panels (from the About section).
  - Recent clips (titles and links).
  - Schedule information (if available).
  - Follower count and subscriber perks.
  - Community features like chat rules.
- Handles static HTML scraping using `BeautifulSoup` and dynamic content rendering using `selenium` or `playwright` (if needed).

### **3. Prompt Engineering Notebook**
- A Jupyter Notebook for testing and refining prompts to generate feedback.
- Allows experimentation with different prompt templates and input data formats.
- Includes examples of structured prompts for tasks such as:
  - Generating content improvement suggestions.
  - Analyzing audience engagement strategies.
  - Providing branding or schedule optimization tips.

### **4. Feedback Generation Pipeline**
- Processes scraped data into structured inputs for the LLM.
- Uses pre-defined templates to generate feedback summaries in categories such as:
  - Content quality (e.g., video/audio setup, overlays).
  - Engagement strategies (e.g., chat interaction, audience retention).
  - Growth tactics (e.g., collaboration opportunities, social media presence).
- Outputs human-readable summaries that can be shared with streamers.

## **Fine-Tuning Roadmap**

Fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) is essential if you want highly specific, domain-relevant feedback tailored to Twitch streamers.

### **When to Fine-Tune**
1. **Data Collection is Complete**: You have a dataset of Twitch-related inputs (e.g., bios, clips) paired with expert-level outputs (feedback).
2. **Prompt Engineering is Exhausted**: Pre-trained models fail to generate consistent or domain-specific responses despite optimized prompts.
3. **Pipeline is Functional**: The scraper and feedback generation pipeline are operational.

### **Steps to Fine-Tune**
1. Prepare your dataset in input-output pairs:
```json
{
  "input": {
    "bio": "...",
    "clips": ["..."],
    "schedule": "...",
    ...
  },
  "output": {
    "content_feedback": "...",
    "engagement_feedback": "...",
    ...
  }
}
```
2. Use frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers or OpenAI’s API for fine-tuning.
3. Train on labeled examples using GPUs or cloud services.

---

## **Next Steps**

1. Refine scraping logic to handle edge cases.
2. Fine-tune an LLM once sufficient labeled data is collected.
3. Deploy the system as an API or web app for real-time usage by streamers.
